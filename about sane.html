    <main>
      <p>I am a mechanical designer and engineer, currently in search of my dream job.
        <br>
        <br>Over the past fourteen years, I have helped to develop products in a number of different industries, including sports equipment, industrial cases and shipping containers, medical devices, retail cosmetics, and optical transceivers for the semiconductor industry.
        <br>
        <br>I think the things that define me best, however, are the personal projects that I've worked on in school or as hobbies.  I have put together this simple website to demonstrate some of the things that I have enjoyed working on the most.

          <p>When not at work, I'm a doting uncle to three nephews and two "fake nieces" (the children of a good friend of mine from undergrad).
          <br>
          <br>I'm also a fan of unusual human-powered vehicles, a casual (<i>very</i> casual) videogamer, and an amateur escape-room enthusiast.</p>
